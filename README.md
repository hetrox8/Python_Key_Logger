# Keylogger Project

## Overview

This project contains a keylogger script written in Python. The keylogger is designed to capture keystrokes on a target machine and perform various actions such as logging keystrokes to a local file, capturing window titles, taking screenshots, and optionally sending logs to a remote server.

## Features

- Captures keystrokes and logs them to a local file.
- Captures window titles to provide context for keystrokes.
- Takes periodic screenshots for additional monitoring.
- Encrypts communication to ensure data privacy.
- Stealth mode option to run silently in the background.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Modify the configuration options in the script (`keylogger.py`) according to your requirements.
3. Deploy the keylogger script to your target machine or distribute it as needed.
4. If sending logs to a remote server, ensure that the server endpoint (`REMOTE_URL`) is correctly configured in the script.
5. Run the keylogger script and monitor the captured data as desired.
